 Continuation of TextBlock work from class. Truncated.java, Centered.java, and RightJustified.java, HorizontallyFlipped.java and VerticallyFlipped.java have been implemented. We have also designed and implemented our own TextBlock Diagonal.java.

 The 3 types of equality checks have also been added in TBUtils as the equal, epv, and eq functions.
